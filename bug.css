This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector like `:hover` or `:focus`.  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly apply the styles when the pseudo-selector is present. For example:

```css
/* styles.css */
.btn {
  @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700;
}
```

This will apply the `bg-blue-500` class, but the `hover:bg-blue-700` won't work as expected. The hover effect will not be applied.
